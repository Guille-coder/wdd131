            <h3>History</h3>

            <div class="collage">
                <p>Our passion for the Philippines was born from our own adventures exploring its islands, meeting its people, and indulging in its cuisine. Every corner of the archipelago has a unique story to tell—from the breathtaking landscapes of Palawan and Boracay to the vibrant streets of Manila and Cebu, rich in history and culture. Throughout our travels, we have experienced the warmth and hospitality of the Filipino people, discovered hidden white-sand beaches, taken part in colorful and festive celebrations, and savored the authentic flavors of local cuisine, from the mouthwatering lechón to the traditional adobo. More than just a destination, the Philippines is an experience that touches the heart.</p>
